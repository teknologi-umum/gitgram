# Gitgram

Github notifications for Telegram

## Backstory

Gitgram was created because our team at that time was working on a big project and we uses Telegram to discuss the project. We needed something to receive Github webhook notifications and send them to the Telegram group to ease our communication without having to check directly on Github. Therefore, a bot was created.

## Features

It sends every notification to the group within these events:

- deployment status
- issue
- issue comment
- ping
- pull request
- pull request reviews
- release
- vulnerabillity alerts

## Usage

### From Docker

A preferably simple and straightforward way to deploy the bot
without any hassle on configuring your machine and such.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teknologi-umum/gitgram.git
cd gitgram
docker build -t gitgram:latest .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name gitgram gitgram:latest
```

Don't forget to supply your own environment variables.

### From source

First you will need to clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/teknologi-umum/gitgram.git
```

and then install all of its dependencies

```bash
# if you're using npm
npm install
# or yarn
yarn install
```

To make the bot work properly, you will need these environment variables.
- `NODE_ENV`
	Used for NodeJS to determine whether the bot is running in production or development.
- `PORT`
	Which port to run the HTTP server.
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
	Your webhook secret. You should see it when you create your Github webhook.
- `BOT_TOKEN`
	Your telegram bot token.
- `DEV_PROXY_URL`
	Webhook proxy URL used for easier development process.
- `HOME_GROUP` (Optional)
	Default group if the repository was not found on the mapping.
- `IGNORE_PRIVATE_REPOSITORY` (Optional)
	Set to anything other than empty to make it ignore every notification from private repository.

Example:

```ini
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
WEBHOOK_SECRET=123456789
BOT_TOKEN=xyzx:isyelacuapwodncnmzdcmajwo
DEV_PROXY_URL=web.com/duffUGHIUGsdsd
```

If you don't know how to make a Telegram bot and get its token, you can refer to [Telegram Bot Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

If you don't know how to make a webhook for Github, you can visit
[Github Webhook Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks)

Build the bot with `npm run build`

Then run the bot with `npm run start`
